# Initial Project
A game inspired by Problem F from the 2023 International Programming Marathon. It features gameplay similar to 2048 with an added twist: gummy glue.

## First Life Cycle Phase:
Establishing the foundational elements of the game. This includes:
1. **Creating the Game Board:**
* Design and implement the layout and structure of the game board.
* Ensure that the board is scalable and adaptable to different game scenarios.

2. **Placing the Tiles:**
* Develop functionality to place and manage game tiles on the board.
* Implement initial tile types and ensure proper placement mechanics.
3. **Implementing Basic Mechanics:**
* Code the fundamental rules and interactions of the game.
* Establish basic game logic to handle player moves and tile interactions.
